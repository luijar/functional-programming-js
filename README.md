# Functional JavaScript Programming

Since this code uses ES6 artifacts, you must transpile your JavaScript code with either:

* Babel
* Traceur


In this code repository you will find:

* All code samples (as runnable unit tests) of code used in chapters
* Sample application (Under Construction)
* Functional data types like Optional, Either, Maybe, etc
* Access to some JavaScript functional libraries like lodash.js, streams.js, bacon.js, etc.
